  }
  return auction.lots.every(lot => lot.status === 'ended');
}

// Modified GET / - Returns only active auctions
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const auctions = readAuctions();
  const activeAuctions = auctions.filter(auction => !isAuctionCompleted(auction));
  res.json(activeAuctions);
});

// New GET /past - Returns only completed auctions
router.get('/past', (req, res) => {
  const auctions = readAuctions();
  const completedAuctions = auctions.filter(auction => isAuctionCompleted(auction));
