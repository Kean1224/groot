# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX - Render Deployment Error

## Problem
Your frontend deployment is failing with: `cd: frontend: No such file or directory`

## Solution
The issue is that Render needs to be told which directory to use as the root for each service.

### Fix Your Frontend Service NOW:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://render.com/
2. **Find your frontend service** (groot-frontend)
3. **Click "Settings"**
4. **Scroll to "Build & Deploy" section**
5. **Change these settings:**
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend` (not empty!)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"**

### For Backend Service:
1. **Find your backend service** (groot-backend)
2. **Click "Settings"**
3. **Scroll to "Build & Deploy" section**
4. **Change these settings:**
   - **Root Directory**: `backend` (not empty!)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
5. **Click "Save Changes"**
6. **Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"**

## Why This Happens
Render was trying to run `cd frontend && npm start` from the project root, but it needs to know that the frontend code is IN the frontend directory, so we set the Root Directory to `frontend` and then just run `npm start`.

## Expected Result
After fixing:
- âœ… Frontend will deploy successfully at `https://groot-frontend.onrender.com`
- âœ… Backend will deploy successfully at `https://groot-backend.onrender.com`
- âœ… Both services will communicate properly

## Still Having Issues?
If you still see errors:
1. Check the **Logs** tab in each service
2. Make sure Environment Variables are set correctly
3. Verify both services are using Node.js environment

**This should fix your deployment immediately!** ðŸš€
