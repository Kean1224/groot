# Push Test - GitHub Sync Issue

This file was created to test the GitHub push functionality.

## Changes Made:
1. Fixed dropdown menu in Header.tsx
2. Added password strengthening in register/page.tsx
3. Both changes are saved locally but not appearing on GitHub

## Date: August 3, 2025
## Issue: Terminal git commands not returning output

The changes are definitely saved in the files, but git push seems to be failing silently.
