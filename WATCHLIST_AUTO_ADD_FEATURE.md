# Auto-Add to Watchlist Feature

## Overview
When a user places a bid on an auction item, the item is now automatically added to their watchlist. This enhances user experience by ensuring they can easily track items they've shown interest in by bidding.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
Modified `frontend/app/auctions/[auctionId]/page.tsx`:

#### Functions Updated:
1. **handlePlaceBid()** - Regular bid placement
2. **handleQuickBid()** - Quick bid buttons 
3. **handleSetAutoBid()** - Auto-bid functionality

#### Logic Added:
```typescript
// Check if item is already in watchlist
const wasAlreadyWatchlisted = watchlist.includes(lotId);

// Add to watchlist if not already there
if (!wasAlreadyWatchlisted) {
  setWatchlist(prev => [...prev, lotId]);
}

// Enhanced notification message
const watchlistMessage = !wasAlreadyWatchlisted ? ' Added to watchlist!' : '';
addNotification(`Bid placed successfully! ${watchlistMessage}`, 'success');
```

### User Experience
- **Automatic Addition**: Items are added to watchlist immediately after successful bid
- **Smart Notifications**: Users are informed when items are added to their watchlist
- **No Duplicates**: Items already in watchlist won't be added again
- **Persistent Storage**: Watchlist is saved to localStorage for persistence

### Affected Bidding Methods
All bidding methods now automatically add items to watchlist:
- ✅ Regular bid button
- ✅ Quick bid buttons (+1, +2, +5, +10 increments)  
- ✅ Auto-bid setup

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced UX**: Users don't need to manually add items they bid on
2. **Better Tracking**: Easy to monitor bidding activity
3. **Increased Engagement**: Users more likely to return to check watchlisted items
4. **Intuitive Behavior**: Matches user expectations - if you bid, you're interested

### Technical Notes
- Uses existing watchlist localStorage mechanism
- No backend changes required
- Maintains all existing watchlist functionality
- Compatible with existing watchlist management features

## Testing
- Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- All existing functionality preserved
- New feature works across all bidding methods
